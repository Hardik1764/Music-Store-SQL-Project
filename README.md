NOTE : {I this project i use MYSQL so if you are using some different software you face little error, as of my knowledge most of query is running same but you facing 2-3 error while running sql query in different sofware
for Example in MYSQL if you are USE and facing error cause due to group by function The error message you received, "Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column...", is indicating that there's a problem with how MySQL is processing your query
In simple terms, MySQL has a mode called only_full_group_by, which requires that every column in the SELECT list that is not an aggregate function (like SUM(), COUNT(), etc.) must also be included in the GROUP BY clause. This mode is designed to ensure that the query results are deterministic and predictable.}
